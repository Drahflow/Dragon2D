Dragon2D is an RPG engine. Its still in hard development, so dont expect much yet.

##compile
To compile for Development, debugging, ... run `make` wich will create the binarys.
But it wont compile out of nothing. You will need SDL2, SDL2_ttf, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer and libglew. 
Also you might want to edit TailTipUI - clone it from my account (mkalte666) and when you're done copy the include- and bin-folder to the TailTipUI-folder in the sources.

You can also do a release build with `make release`, cleanup with `make clean` and pack a release with `make pack`

Thats it for now.
