# Dragon2D
Dragon2D is a 2D Rpg engine written in D2! (yes i switched there from c++) 

## Why D
There are many reasons why i decided to use D. One is the safer design of the language making it hard to have things like memory leaks (yay garbage collection). 
Other reasons are the modular design and the readability. However i will cover this sometime in the future in the Dragon2D github wiki.

## How to install 
You want to use Dragon2D, right? Well, here is how. 
### Compiler
The Compiler for Dragon2D is dmd (or gdc or ldc). If you have an rdmd (comes with dmd) installed, you can just enter
`make` for debug and `make release` for a release build. 
If you are on windows without Visual-D or make somewhere, the commands you need are still written plain in the makefile.
### Librarys
You will need, somewhere on your system, the following librarys: SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, OpenGl3 (should be installed...)
Also for you windows people: the dlls come with the engine (even with the source), so you probably dont have to install them. 
You probably need the dbg and dev versions... 

## How to use
Look in the wiki! I will shurely fill it with infos soon! SOON.
